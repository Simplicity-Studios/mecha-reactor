## Enemy Beastiary 

#### The Shooter
![Enemy Shooter](https://i.imgur.com/ZSiovek.png)
- The enemy shooter, the most basic of basic enemies. Will slowly walk up to you while firing on you. A simple enemy but dangerous in big numbers.

#### The Melee Bot
![Enemy Melee](https://i.imgur.com/MOEi1P2.png)
- The melee bot, deceptively strong. Will run at you and execute a melee attack on you whenever it gets the chance. 

#### The EMP Bot
![EMPBot](https://i.imgur.com/rBAYY3o.png)
- The EMP Bot, a slow robot that will ocassionally release an EMP blast. Along with some damage, it will also completely disable a random reactor for a certain time!

#### The Laser Tower
![Laser Tower](https://i.imgur.com/q1pJUwl.png)
- An unmoving enemy, if caught directly in your line of sight, will slowly charge a laser that will fire upon you when it finishes charging. High damage but zero mobility.

#### The Absorber
![Absorber](https://i.imgur.com/GuGFXll.png)
- A unique enemy that will charge an energy wave that can pierce through walls and cover. Any damage given to it during the charge time period will be returned back in the wave damage! Avoid wildly firing upon this enemy or pay the price.

#### The Shielder
![Shielder](https://i.imgur.com/Uks9jzQ.png)
- An enemy with a slowly rotating shield that it will constantly use to cover itself from your attacks, while firing upon you. Huh, if only you were a little faster...

#### The "Mechanical Climax"
![FinalBoss](https://i.imgur.com/MQOZbVo.png)
- The finale, a massive mech with slow movement but a bulky defense. He will utilize many attacks to try to end you, including a few that should already be familiar. And watch out; you don't want to make him angry. Can you conquer the final challenge?
